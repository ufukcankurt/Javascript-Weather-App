# Javascript-Weather-App

ðŸŒ¦ You can easily learn the weather forecast of the city you want.

ðŸ›  The app built with Vanilla JS and Fetch API.

I learned how to use fetch API in this project. I made two different API queries and used the information I got from them. Like that;

- **[Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/)**
- **[Map Box](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/search/geocoding/)**
